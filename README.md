# üëã Hi, I'm Mohammad Masarra

### üí° ML Engineer | Data Scientist | Computer Vision

I recently finished my Master‚Äôs in AI Systems at EPITA in Paris. Over the past couple of years, I‚Äôve worked on 15+ machine learning projects‚Äîfrom chatbots and computer vision apps to full MLOps pipelines. During my internship at Quantlake, I helped build real-time tools used by 230+ finance clients and was rated a top 5% intern by the CEO. I enjoy turning complex ideas into working solutions and always look for ways to make tech more useful and practical.
