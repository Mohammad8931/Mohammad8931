### Machine Learning Engineer | Data Scientist | Computer Vision Engineer

I am a recent graduate of EPITA’s Master's program in Artificial Intelligence Systems, with hands-on experience developing and deploying machine learning solutions. My work spans the full ML lifecycle—from data pipelines and model development to real-time deployment—across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and MLOps.

During my internship at Quantlake, I contributed to tools used by over 230 financial clients, including a regime prediction engine and a production-ready RAG-based chatbot. My contributions were recognized with a top 5% intern rating from the CEO. I have completed more than 15 projects, consistently focusing on delivering practical, scalable, and reliable machine learning systems.
