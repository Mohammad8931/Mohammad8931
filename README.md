# Mohammad Masarra

### ML Engineer | Data Scientist | Computer Vision Engineer 

I recently completed my Master’s in AI Systems at EPITA in Paris. Over the past couple of years, I’ve worked on more than 15 machine learning projects, including production-grade systems, computer vision applications, and full MLOps pipelines. During my internship at Quantlake, I contributed to tools used by over 230 investment clients and was rated a top 5% intern by the CEO. I focus on building real solutions and making machine learning work in real-world scenarios.

## Experience Highlights

- Quantitative Analyst Intern at Quantlake  
  Built an economic regime predictor, risk classification system, and a RAG-based chatbot for client interaction. Developed automated data pipelines and real-time monitoring tools for financial portfolios.

- Math and Robotics Instructor  
  Created and taught over 1,000 video lessons in advanced mathematics. Taught Arduino-based robotics with a focus on sensor integration and autonomous navigation.
