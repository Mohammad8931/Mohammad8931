# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammad Masarra

### 💡 Machine Learning Engineer | AI Systems Specialist

I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. I recently completed my Master's in Artificial Intelligence Systems at EPITA (Paris), where I led my team to win 1st place in the optimization competition. I've delivered 15+ end-to-end ML projects across computer vision, NLP, MLOps, and finance.
